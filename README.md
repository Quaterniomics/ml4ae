# Statistical Analysis of Biological Age Using GTEx Muscle Tissue Methylation Data

## Introduction
This report employs R to analyze GTEx muscle tissue methylation data for biological age prediction and tissue classification. The goal is to apply statistical techniques for insights into aging and disease mechanisms.

## Analysis 1: Elastic Net Regression

**Objective:** Predict biological age from methylation data.

**Method:** Elastic Net Regression, a blend of Lasso and Ridge.

**LaTeX Representation:** 
```
min β { N1 ∑ i=1N (yi −xiT β)2 +λ[α∥β∥1 + 12 (1−α)∥β∥22 ]}
```

**Conclusions:** Effective in identifying key methylation sites for age prediction.

## Analysis 2: Unsupervised Classification

**Objective:** Classify muscle tissue samples.

**Method:** K-means clustering.

**LaTeX Representation:** 
```
min S ∑ i=1k ∑ x∈Si ∥x−μi∥2
```

**Conclusions:** Distinct clusters suggest unique epigenetic patterns.

## Analysis 3: 3D UMAP Visualization

**Objective:** Visualize methylation data.

**Method:** UMAP for dimensionality reduction.

**LaTeX Representation:** UMAP's formulation involves complex topological concepts, not easily represented in a single equation.

**Conclusions:** Insightful visualizations of methylation patterns.

## Overall Conclusion
The combination of predictive modeling, clustering, and data visualization in R offers a comprehensive approach to understanding epigenetics in aging and tissue-specific research.
